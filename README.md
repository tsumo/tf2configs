# tf2configs to make you topscore
_not really_

1. **autoexec.cfg** - basically Comanglia's toaster config with minimal touch-ups
2. **default_binds.cfg** and **default_settings.cfg**

    Contain all my default stuff. Those two get called inside every class config and serve as base for all other changes.
    Take a look, a lot of nitfy little things got accumulated there during years.

    **Highlights**:

    * Press alt to say "thanks!" (thank your medic, jerk!).
    * Mouse wheel up for primary weapon, down for secondary, q for melee.
    * Press o to express your frustration (╯'□')╯︵ ┻━┻
    * Assortment of voice commands binded on numpad
    * tab shows netgraph together with score table
    * Standard issue null-cancelling movement script
    * and not a single lenny bind!

3. **scout.cfg** - as with almost all other classes, viewmodel is disabled for primary weapon, but enabled for secondary and melee
4. **soldier.cfg** - nothing here
5. **pyro.cfg** - decreased viewmodel_fov for melee weapons - brings them closer to edge of the screen, clears it a little bit of space
6. **demoman.cfg** - nothing here, demoman takes skill, not binds
7. **heavyweapons.cfg** - hide weapon viewmodel after firing first shot (shotguns take too much space on the screen, making fatscouting less enjoyable)
8. **engineer.cfg** - 1 2 3 and 4 to bring up building blueprints, add shift to quickly destroy them and rebuild again
9. **medic.cfg** - heart of this whole collection

    * First of all we have toggleable team messages for activating and faking ubers. Off by default, since i'm just a pub scrub.
    * Hold right mouse button to bring up medigun and use uber as quickly as possible, no matter what weapon you're holding right now.
    * While you're holding your medigun, scroll down with mouse wheel to mask uber and snear at your dumb patients at the same time! Dummkopfs!
    * 1 activates mvm shield, 2 switches vaccinator resistances, 3 engages medic radar

10. **sniper.cfg** - activate Hitman's Heatmaker by scrolling up with mouse wheel
11. **spy.cfg** - stabby's config. Clever viewmodel hacks, fast dual-level disguising on 123
12. **jump.cfg** - regen for jumps maps
